# Tagesschau News Page

I just wanted to create a minimalistic website that shows me the top news of the German news site "Tagesschau" because Apple disabled the News app in EU so now i can quickly see the most important topics again.

For the project i used the api of Andreas Fischer that you can find under: https://github.com/AndreasFischer1985/tagesschau-api
